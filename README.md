# Node.js Express Mongo TypeScript Template

This is a starter template for creating a Node.js web application using the Express.js framework, MongoDB as the database, and TypeScript for type checking.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v14.x or later)
-   MongoDB (v4.x or later)

## Usage

To use this template, click on the **Use this template** button on the repository page and follow the prompts. This will create a new repository based on this template that you can customize and use as a starting point for your own project.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/suhamchbty/expressjs-template.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```shell
cd expressjs-template
npm install
```

3. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the environment variables with your own values.
4. Start the development server: `npm run start:dev`

This will start the server with `nodemon`, which will watch for changes in the code and automatically restart the server.

## Scripts

-   `npm run start:dev`: Start the server in development mode with `nodemon`.
-   `npm run build`: Build the TypeScript code into JavaScript and output it to the `build` directory.
-   `npm start`: Build the TypeScript code and start the server in production mode.
